In this app, you can contact the API that listens on a given port
for a log-in and then an access to a resource that is password protected.
You access the app either through axios or fetch. Credentials are needed to
be sent since you tell the API what session id is in the header cookie that
identifies this sesion.
Disable/Enable the "loginExample" function and the "getResource" function
by removing/adding a 1 at the end of the function to switch.
